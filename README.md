# EmployeeManagementTool
This project stores the information of Employees such as Id ,Name,Designation, Gender, DateOfBirth etc.It's a desktop application built using Java Awt componenets.
The main feature of this project is - it stores the replica of data of Employee in RAM as well as in Database. This storage of data in memory makes the CRUD operation fast
as compared to, if we store the data in database and then extract it.

# Usecase-
Can be used to store Employee specific information and you can customize it as per your convinience.

It is categorized into three modules- Presentation Layer (UI part) Business Layer (Custom in Memory Database Management) Data Layer (Database Mysql)

I have provided batch files in each directory to compile and execute the code of each layer separately .So you don't need to write the jar files in your classpath, just execute the batch file.

Later converted this module into network programming. The network directory contains all the code required for network programming.
